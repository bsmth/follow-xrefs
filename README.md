# follow-xrefs

## Features

Follow internal markdown cross-references.
Built for use in (en-US) `mdn/content` but may be useful beyond that if improved / forked.

## Extension settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `mdn-xrefs.scanFiles`: Scan a workspace directory for MDN document slugs.

## Known Issues

Locale is hardcoded to `en-US`. This should be configurable in future.

## Developing

Some docs can be found in [Developing.md](./developing.md)
